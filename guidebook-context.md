## Overview
The Ring Road (Route 1) encircles Iceland, connecting many of the most popular attractions. At 1,332-kilometer (828-mi) length, the Ring Road is the most accessible route around the country. Driving along, you'll encounter breathtaking landscapes ranging from towering mountains to barren lava fields to glaciers looming in the distance.

The Ring Road is popular for a reason: The loop is a convenient way to see the best of Iceland's nature, starting with the most popular attractions in the south to lesser-known gems around the island. For travelers who have at least 10 days, driving the Ring Road is ideal, the best use of time to see as much as possible without backtracking to one or two bases.
