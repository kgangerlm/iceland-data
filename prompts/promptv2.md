Now, create a detailed itinerary following these guidelines:

1. For each day, provide 3-5 activity options, combining guidebook suggestions and the traveler's interests. Highlight the main suggested activity.
2. Include low-key spontaneous activities for each area.
3. Note any activities that need pre-booking and suggest where to book.
4. Check for overlapping lodging and note cancellation deadlines if applicable.
5. For hiking, include average round trip time, distance, difficulty, and a brief description of why it's recommended.
6. For tours or activities, note the estimated time required.
7. Include these practical considerations daily:
   - Likely access to groceries
   - Driving times and fuel stops
   - Lodging suggestions if not already booked
   - Cancellation deadlines for any lodging and any conflicting bookings in the itinerary. 
   - Any other relevant planning considerations. Please think hard and don't limit yourself to just what I asked for. 
8. Provide a budget breakdown based on existing bookings and estimated costs for unbooked items. Make sure existing booking costs are only drawn from information I provided

Before presenting the final itinerary, analyze and plan the itinerary in <itinerary_analysis> tags inside your thinking block. In your analysis:

1. Summarize key information from the guidebook, provided details and existing itinerary from tripit.
2. List out all the traveler's preferences and constraints.
3. Brainstorm potential activities for each day based on location and preferences. Be creative and thorough with your brainstorming!
4. Check for any potential conflicts or issues in the itinerary.
5. Consider the season, timezone, and any potential issues with the itinerary.
6. Reference the example itineraries provided earlier to ensure a similar level of detail and structure in your planning.
7. Convert all costs to USD and distances to miles
8. For each day think about potential bad weather and what we would do that day.

Present your final itinerary here is an example of considerations. It is important that you format information the best way you see fit

Remember to highlight any areas that require special attention during the planning process and organize information that will be useful while traveling. If you're unsure about any information provided, please ask for clarification rather than inventing details.

Add a section at the beginning that includes the top 10 things we should be currently focusing on deciding or booking remember the planning phase and focus on things that need to be decided or booked first

If relevant to the planning phase I gave you below Then a seperate sub section with any notes that we need to accomplish directly before the trip (visa information, any specific items I asked you to note ect) 

Your final output should consist only of the itinerary using the format listed above as a rough guideline and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking block.

## MOST IMPORTANT Trip Planning Guidelines
- Current phase: [Initial planning/Finalizing details/Day-of logistics]
- Today's date: [Current date]
- Trip dates: [Planned trip dates]

Key facts: 
- Always reference items I gave you in the trip it itinerary, those are things we have booked or decided on.  Second prefer "special interests" that I provided you.  These should always be highest priority items unless I specify otherwise. 
- All costs should be converted to USD, all distances should be in miles
- If you want to change overnight locations check it against the existing tripit itenerary, look at cancelation policy, and make a note of the change in the planning section for that day as well as your summary at the front of the itenerary. 

Key priorities:
- Include multiple hiking options daily where available
- Include departure/arrival time estimates between locations
- Note timing (morning/afternoon/evening) for activities and dining
- Include driving times and activity durations
- Focus on [planning tasks/practical details] based on proximity to trip date
- Include multiple items from my specific interests: [list your interests here]

In initial planning phase, prioritize information for key decisions (lodging, tours, must-see highlights).
In final planning phase, prioritize practical considerations and daily flexibility.
