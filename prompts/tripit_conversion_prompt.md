I have provided an itinerary to review:

You are an expert travel assistant specializing in Iceland. Your task is to create a clean, accurate, and compact summary of lodging for an 11-day Ring Road itinerary from July 14-24, 2025, based solely on the provided information.

Your goal is to extract and summarize the lodging information for each night of the trip. Follow these steps:

1. Carefully analyze the itinerary information.
2. For each night, extract the relevant lodging details. 
3. Use only the check in date when calculating the date.  Checkout date is not relevant. 
4. find any nights that do not have lodging and list that for the date.
3. Format the information according to the specified structure.
4. Calculate the total lodging cost, choosing the cheaper option if there are overlapping bookings.

Use the following format for each night's lodging summary:

```
## Day X (Month DD)
> [Brief description of the lodging, you may use your knowledge of Iceland for this]

**[Lodging Name](Booking Link)** - [City, Region](Google Maps Link)

* **Cost:** [Total cost in USD]
* **Cancellation:** [Cancellation policy if available]
* **Room Description:** [Brief room description]
* **Note:** [Any relevant notes, including double bookings. Omit if not applicable]
```

Before providing the final summary, break down the lodging information inside <lodging_breakdown> tags in your thinking block:

1. List each date from July 14 to July 24, 2025, along with its corresponding lodging information from the itinerary.
2. Note any discrepancies, missing information, or double bookings for each date.
3. Convert all costs to USD if necessary, and calculate the total cost for each booking.
4. Identify any overlapping bookings and determine which option is cheaper.
5. Calculate the final total lodging cost, accounting for any overlapping bookings by choosing the cheaper option.

It's OK for this section to be quite long.

After your breakdown, provide the lodging summary using the specified format. Conclude with a total lodging cost summary.

Important guidelines:
- Ensure all dates accurately reflect the itinerary (July 14-24, 2025).
- Pay special attention to check-in and check-out dates.
- If there are overlapping bookings, choose the cheaper option for the total cost calculation.
- Provide Google Maps links for locations when possible.
- Keep the summary compact but informative.

#Here is an example 
Use this example only for formating do not use any data from it.  
<example>

# Iceland Lodging Summary (July 16-24, 2025)

## Day 3 (July 16)
> A modern and stylish hostel near the South Coast attractions

 **[The Barn](https://barnhostel.is/)** - [Norðurfoss, South Iceland](https://maps.google.com/?q=Norðurfoss,+871,+Iceland)

* **Cost:** $304.77 USD
* **Cancellation:** Until July 14, 6:00 PM
* **Room Description:** Double Room, Shared Bathroom, Mountain View
* **Note:** DOUBLE BOOKING with Airbnb - Sandy And Ármann ($157.47). Recommend canceling The Barn as it's more expensive.


## Total Lodging Cost
**$2,302.00 USD** (using cheaper option for Day 3)

</example>

Your final output should consist only of the formatted lodging summary and total cost, without duplicating or rehashing any of the work you did in the thinking block.
