# Iceland Trip Planning Prompts
## Introduction
This README provides guidance on using the Iceland trip planning prompts to generate a lodging summary for an 11-day Ring Road itinerary.

## Prompt Overview
The prompts are designed to help create a clean, accurate, and compact summary of lodging for the trip. They provide a structured approach to analyzing the itinerary, extracting lodging details, and formatting the information.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Generate Plan**: Use the provided prompt to generate a plan for the 11-day trip. Save the output as a markdown file named `iceland-trip-plan.md`.
2. **Save Plan**: Ensure the plan is saved correctly and can be referenced later.
3. **Remember Example Prompt**: Recall the example prompt provided, which demonstrates the desired formatting for the lodging summary.
4. **Generate Final**: Use the generated plan to create a final lodging summary, following the specified format and structure.

## Important Notes
* The prompts are designed to be used in a specific order, with each step building on the previous one.
* The example prompt should be used as a reference for formatting, but not as a source of data.
* Extending the thinking process is recommended to ensure accuracy and completeness of the lodging summary.

## Output
The final output should be a markdown file containing the formatted lodging summary, including:
* A brief description of each lodging
* Lodging name, location, and booking link
* Cost, cancellation policy, and room description
* Any relevant notes, including double bookings

The total lodging cost should be calculated, choosing the cheaper option for any overlapping bookings.

## File Naming Convention
Save the final markdown file as `iceland-trip-plan.md`.
