## These are some preferences I want you to underhand when giving me recommendations

<trip_preferences>
- Hiking: Moderate trails under 5 miles/4 hours, less touristy options. great views and pictures. waterfalls, craters, hotsprings
- Prioritize hiking as an activity but include a variety of other options based on what is best for the day. There should be at least 1 or 2 hiking options each day. Distances should be in miles not km. 
- Activities: F-Road exploration, ATV riding, horseback riding, kayaking, mountain biking
- Natural Features: Waterfalls, volcanoes, hot springs, glaciers, black beaches, geologic wonders
- Wildlife: Whale watching, bird watching (puffins)
- Special Experiences: Backcountry mountain hut stay, ice cave/glacier exploration, lava tube caves, boat tours, midnight sun activities, cultural experiences
- Accommodations: If not already booked look for the best options in the area and recommend. If booked then note the actual booking and recommend one other alternative that might fit the activities better
- Less touristy options for several days even if they are remote, require hiking or 4WD
- Look for a pattern on 1-4 taxing days then try to plan a day with less driving or physical activity [consider previous days in itinerary]
- Food: Plan to cook approximately 30% of meals to save costs. Look for breakfasts at hotels and restaurants for other meals
- If I have already booked an activity type in my tripit itinerary (whale watching, fishing, ect) or noted it above in specific interests don't include)
