## These are some preferences I want you to underhand when giving me recommendations

<trip_preferences>
- Hiking: Moderate trails under 5 miles/4 hours, less touristy options. great views and pictures. waterfalls, craters, hotsprings
- Prioritize hiking as an activity but include a variety of other options based on what is best for the day. There should be at least 1 or 2 hiking options each day. Distances should be in miles not km. 
- Activities: ATV riding, horseback riding, kayaking, mountain biking
- Natural Features: Waterfalls, volcanoes, hot springs, glaciers
- Wildlife: Whale watching, bird watching (puffins)
- Special Experiences: Backcountry mountain hut stay, ice cave/glacier exploration, lava tube caves, boat tours, midnight sun activities, cultural experiences
- Accommodations: If not already booked look for the best options in the area and recommend. If booked then note the actual booking and recommend one other alternative that might fit the activities better
- Food: Plan to cook approximately 30% of meals to save costs. Look for breakfasts at hotels and restaurants for other meals
- If I have already booked an activity type in my tripit itinerary (whale watching, fishing, ect) or noted it above in specific interests don't include)
