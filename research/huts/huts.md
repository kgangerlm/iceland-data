# Iceland mountain huts
### About mountain huts
===================

The Icelandic Tourist Board and its branches have 41 cabins across the country. Anyone can use the cabins, regardless of membership in the Icelandic Tourist Board, but members receive discounted rates.

During the summer, there are hut guards at most of the larger huts located along busy hiking trails, such as on [Laugavegur](https://www.fi.is/is/gonguleidir/yfirlit-gonguleida/laugavegur) .

The sleeping spaces in the most popular cabins are full, so we strongly recommend that people book accommodation and secure a space in advance. Those with confirmed reservations will be given priority in the cabins. If there is space, FÍ members will be next in line.

The cabins are locked during the winter, but you can book accommodation and obtain keys for most of the cabins at the FÍ office, Mörkinn 6.

The largest cabins have both running water and flush toilets, but in some of the smaller ones you have to fetch water from nearby streams and use a bucket.

Camping is available at most of the FÍ mountain huts for a fee. Campers must bring their own stove and cooking utensils as they do not have access to the huts' cooking facilities. See [the price list for hut and camping accommodation](https://www.fi.is/is/skalar/gistiskilmalar) .

Day visitors are required to pay a facility fee when they stay in the cabin areas for part of the day and use the facilities, such as picnic facilities, barbecues, and restrooms.

It is a good idea to check the accessibility of the huts at the Icelandic Road Administration: [vegagerdin.is](http://www.vegagerdin.is/) , phone: 1777

## Cabin rules
===========

We all want to have a good stay in a mountain cabin after a difficult journey through the mountains and wilderness. It's simple if everyone follows a few rules of etiquette.

The main principle is that access is convenient and that the cabins can be comfortable accommodations for mountain travelers. Cleanliness is therefore of great importance and consideration for one's neighbors is key.
