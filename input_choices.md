# Current Itinerary

## The following is the most important information I will give you.  I will specifically refer to it using it's enclosing tag current_itinerary

This contains my current thoughts on what I want the itinerary to be.  Please use this as preferences, but also consider the other context that I give you.  This should not be used as guidance for formatting output. I will give that information separately.

when reviewing the information I provided you here remember instructions enclosed in [] these are things I want you to use your other knowledge and especially other context I gave you to fill in.  Of course you might encounter this as a markdown link so don't be confused by that.

Consider anything in this document enclosed in tags </> as context for you not something you should ever output. 

Never output the preference information for each day when generating the itinerary. That is for your informational purposes
