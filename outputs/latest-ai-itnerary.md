**Practical Considerations**:

- Airport arrival: Plan to be at Keflavík Airport 2.5 hours before flight (by 2:20pm)
- Flight details: KEF → DEN (FI 671) at 4:50 PM (Confirmation: 3NEJSO)
- Rental car return: Allow 30-45 minutes for return process and shuttle to terminal
- Dining options: Light lunch in Reykjavík; airport has several dining options
- Tax refund: Process VAT tax refund at airport if eligible for purchases over $30

**Planning TODO**:
1. Check rental car return requirements and location
2. Plan route back to Keflavík with potential stops
3. Research parking options in Reykjavík if stopping
4. Set reminder for online check-in for flight
5. Make list of any last-minute souvenirs to purchase
